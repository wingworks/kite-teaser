# Learn to sew a kite #
This pattern is intended to improve your sewing skills.
You can not use this kite for kitesurfing, it will not fly!

The diameters of the leading edge and the struts correspond approx. to a kite in size 9(sqm). 
Sail panels and segments are shorter so you need less dacron and spinnaker than for a "real" kite.
